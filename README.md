## Installation

1. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    ```ruby
    gem "beyond_canvas"
    ```

1. Then execute:

    ```bash
    $ bundle install
    ```

1. Restart your server and rename `application.css` to `application.scss` or `application.sass` (in case you prefer to use the `sass` syntax):

    ```bash
    $ mv app/assets/stylesheets/application.css app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss
    ```

1. Delete _all_ Sprockets directives in `application.scss` (`require`, `require_tree` and `require_self`) and use Sass’s native `@import` instead ([Here's why?](https://content.pivotal.io/blog/structure-your-sass-files-with-import)).

1. Import Beyond Canvas at the beginning of `application.scss`. Any other styles must be imported after Beyond Canvas to avoid issues:

    ```scss
    @import 'beyond_canvas'
    ```

1. Add the following to `application.js`:

    ```js
    //= require beyond_canvas
    ```

1. Run the generator:

    ```bash
    $ rails g beyond_canvas:install
    ```

    This will generate `config/initializers/beyond_canvas.rb` file, used for general Beyond Canvas configuration. Read [this wiki entry](https://github.com/ePages-de/beyond_canvas/wiki/Initializer) to get more information about the different configuration options.
